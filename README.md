# Surfs Up Weather Analysis
### Overview
In this analysis we analyse data from Oahu, Hawaii, to decide whether or not opening a surf shop is a good idea, and if it is expandable. Mr. W. Avy, my investor, is wondering if the weather conditions are stable, and he especially wants me to aquire about the months of June and December.

### Summary

For a more in-depth analysis, it would be a good idea to inquire about the difference in rainfall in June and December, as well as how many days it rains in each of the months.
