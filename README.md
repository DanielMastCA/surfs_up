# Surfs Up Weather Analysis
### Overview
In this analysis we analyse weather data from Oahu, Hawaii, to decide whether or not it is a good idea to open a surf shop, and if it is expandable to other areas. Mr. W. Avy, my investor, is wondering if the weather conditions are stable enough to run the surf shop all year round, and he especially wants me to inquire about the months of June and December.

### Results

### Summary

The average temperatures in June and December are not much different from each other, with temperatures in the 70's, and June averaging about 4 degrees warmer than December. For a more in-depth analysis, it would be a good idea to inquire about the difference in rainfall in June and December, as well as how many days it rains in each of the months.
